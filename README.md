# Assignment 0 Hello Web

This assignment challenges you to go through the HTML5, CSS/CSS3, and Javascript/JS tutorials and answer some quick Google questions. This material is effectively its own course in CINS110, that is the pre-requisite to CINS465 now; however, as I'm not requiring CINS110 if you choose to not take it prior to this course you are responsible for learning HTML5, CSS, and JS mostly on your own. This material will be imperative to being successful in this class; however, it will have minimal time in class as I'll mostly be using these tools in relation to the web framework used in this class.
